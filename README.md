**Huffman Encoding**

This project contains two types of Huffman Encode: the basic one and adaptive one. 

The basic one works only in one session if you only code and decode. It does not save frequencies dictionary at all. Also it works only with .txt files. But the files will be actually coded into bytes and will have lower size.

The adaptive one works anytime only with .txt files. But it doesn't save encoded file with bytes, but with strings. So its size will be even more bigger.

So, if you would like to take any code from here - than keep it all in mind. I don't have any free time to make it better :(
